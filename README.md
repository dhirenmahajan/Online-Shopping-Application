# Online Shopping Application
   
Welcome to the README file for the Online Shopping Application project. This project aims to develop a comprehensive online shopping platform using a PostgreSQL database backend.  
   
## Project Overview  
   
In this project, each group builds its own online shopping application. The backend is powered by a PostgreSQL database that stores information about products, their availability, orders, customer details, and staff information for the store.  
   
## Project Outputs  
   
The project has three main deliverables:  
   
### Part 1  
   
#### 1. ER Model  
- Developed an Entity-Relationship (ER) model for the application.  
- Submit the ER model in jpeg, png, or pdf format.  
   
#### 2. Relational Schema  
- Translate the ER model into a relational schema implemented as an SQL script.  
- The script should use PostgreSQL dialect and execute without errors.  
- Define tables, constraints, and create indices where appropriate.  
- Submit the script as a simple `.sql` file.  
   
### Part 2  
   
#### 3. Application  
- Develop an online shopping application using the relational schema defined in the first two deliverables.  
- The application can be either a web or desktop application.  
   
#### Customers  
- Search for products and look up information about products.  
- Set up an account and change preferences and account details.  
- Order products and make payments.  
- Record customer details such as name, addresses (for delivery and payment), and credit card information.  
- Maintain the current balance of the customerâ€™s account.  
   
#### Staff Members  
- Modify and create products, update product availability, query customer information, and process orders.  
- Record staff details such as name, address, salary, and job title.

#### Suppliers  
- Store supplier information including address and name.
